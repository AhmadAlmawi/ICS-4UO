# ICS-4UO: Grade 12 Computer Science

In the course, we learned standard computer science topics such as inheritance, recursion, abstractions, and API use through the developement of data structures like linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, hash tables, and so on. This repository is a collection of some of my work throughout the semester. Near the end of the course we experimented with GUIs, my project of which can be found [here](https://github.com/amanda-plotnik/EmployeeDatabase).
